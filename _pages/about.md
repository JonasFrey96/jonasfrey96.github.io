I am a PostDoc at Stanford (Autonmous System Lab) with Marco Pavone and UC Berkeley (BAIR) with Jitendra Malik.
My research focuses on **Learning Perception and Navigation for Legged Robots** with a focus on combining **RL policies and Large Behaviour Models**.

I obtained my Ph.D. in robotics at the Robotic Systems Lab at **ETH Zurich** and the **Max Planck Institute** for Intelligent Systems, co-advised by Prof. Marco Hutter and Prof. Georg Martius.
During my Ph.D. I joined **NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory** as a visiting researcher and continuously collaborate with the Dynamic Robotic Systems Group by Prof. Maurice Fallon at **University of Oxford**.
I worked as a **Collaborative Robotics Engineer** at SEW-Eurodrive before starting my Master's in **Robotics Systems and Control** at ETH Zurich. Throughout my Master's I was supervised by Prof. Roland Siegwart and spent most of my time at the **Autonmous Systems Lab**.
During my Bachelor's, I worked at the chair for **High Performance Humanoid Technologies** with Prof. Tamim Asfour (KIT, Germany) and conducted my Bachelor's Thesis with Prof. Takamitsu Matsubara in Japan (NAIST, Japan).
